StyloMorph
Transform Faces into Art with Precision and Simplicity

Overview
StyloMorph is a cutting-edge face stylization system designed to transform facial features into specific artistic styles while preserving unique individual characteristics. By leveraging pre-trained models and efficient computational techniques, StyloMorph delivers high-quality results quickly, democratizing artistic expression for everyone.

Key Features
Efficient and Fast: Achieves real-time face stylizations with significantly lower computational requirements than traditional methods.
Style Versatility: Utilizes StyleGAN2 and e4e models, trained on the diverse FFHQ dataset, to ensure robustness across various facial features, lighting conditions, and ethnic profiles.
Precision Mapping: Integrates DLib Shape Predictor with 68 facial landmarks for accurate face detection and mapping into latent space.
Customizable Styles: Enables fine-tuned artistic transformations by manipulating latent spaces, allowing for targeted style application while retaining original facial characteristics.
User-Friendly: Simplifies the process of artistic transformation, making it accessible to both professionals and hobbyists.

How It Works
StyloMorph combines state-of-the-art models and tools to create a seamless face stylization pipeline:

Face Detection:

Uses DLib Shape Predictor to detect and map facial features with 68 precise landmarks.
Latent Space Encoding:

Encodes facial features into latent space using the e4e encoder, preserving essential details.
Style Application:

Manipulates the encoded latent space with StyleGAN2 to apply artistic transformations.
Output Generation:

Produces high-quality, styled images that retain original facial characteristics while adopting the chosen artistic style.
